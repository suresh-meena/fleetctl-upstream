# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Forward JSON stdout and stderr capture limits through SSH, restoring
  `exec --json` and the other bounded remote result paths.
- `sync --delete` now passes checked canonical destinations to rsync for remote
  paths and local pulls, so a symlink at the originally requested path cannot
  be repointed after the safety check to redirect deletion.
- Require `remote_script_root` to resolve to a dedicated `/fleet/scripts` path
  before staging or pruning, preventing cleanup from targeting shared or system data.
- Require `--admin` for interactive SSH to Slurm login targets, and reject
  relative `sbatch` executables in Slurm submit profiles and live preflight.
- Require Slurm profiles to invoke `sbatch` directly and pass the staged script
  as the final argument, preventing a misconfigured submit profile from running
  a job directly on the login node.
- Refuse `fleetctl script` on Slurm login targets even with `--admin`, preventing
  staged direct execution from bypassing the scheduler; `exec --admin` remains
  available for login control-plane commands.
- `sync transfer` now stops with an uncertainty error after a dispatched peer
  rsync fails, instead of retrying a potentially partial write through relay;
  pre-transfer peer setup and probe failures can still fall back.

### Added
- Optional `--expected-role workstation|login` on `fleetctl exec` and `sync push|pull`,
  checked against the target's locally resolved inventory role before connecting.
  `sync transfer` rejects the option because it has two target roles.
- `fleetctl preflight <script> --target <target>`: an offline `#SBATCH`
  checker that reports what the scheduler would reject, with a stable rule ID
  per finding (`SH*` shell, `SLURM*` generic semantics, `FS*`, `MOD*`, and the
  site's own `rule_prefix`, e.g. `KIAC023`). `submit` runs it before opening a
  connection and refuses on ERROR; `--no-preflight` skips it and `--strict`
  lets a warning refuse too, and `--live` adds an `sbatch --test-only` dry run
  on the target, admitted as `submit` is and skipped when the offline checks
  already failed. Exit 0 clean, 1 warnings, 2 refused. Ported from the
  standalone `slurm-helper` skill, which this replaces.
- Site policy as declared config, so the preflight can enforce what
  `sbatch --test-only` will not: per queue, `max_time`, `allowed_accounts`,
  `denied_accounts`, `required_qos`, `account_required`, `gres_types`,
  `gpu_only`, `nodes`, plus `evidence` and `as_of`; per protocol,
  `gpu_vendor`, `preferred_storage`, `home_prefix`, `storage_caveat` and
  `rule_prefix`. A dry run accepts an account the partition forbids and the
  job then pends forever, so the matrix is checked locally from data rather
  than left to the scheduler to reveal later.
- `doctor` now warns when a queue claiming `verified-by-run`/`verified-live`
  has no `as_of`, an unreadable one, or one older than 180 days -- so
  "verified" cannot quietly decay into "was true once".
- Claude Code now links the shared `codex/skills` library into
  `~/.claude/skills` via `setup_claude_skills`, installing the
  `remote-fleet-operator` (fleetctl) skill alongside Codex and ZCode
- `fleetctl sync transfer <src>[:<path>] <dst>[:<path>]`: target-to-target
  rsync that runs on the source and reaches the destination over one
  agent-forwarded ssh hop, falling back to the local pull-then-push relay when
  the peer path cannot run; `--relay` forces the relay, `--no-fallback` refuses
  it, and both endpoints are admitted and `--delete`-guarded like a `sync push`
- AMD GPU cluster context from the supplied `AMD Server.pdf`, linked from the
  fleet operator skill and fleetctl guide, with Slurm rules and source errata.
- `fleetctl`, a private XDG-based fleet inventory and remote execution helper with host-level target workdirs, project bindings, SSH alias import, env migration, sync, script, submit, and doctor flows
- Global Codex fleet instructions and a `remote-fleet-operator` skill for routing remote work through `fleetctl`
- Emacs daemon service configuration for mileva and sparck machines
- Git completions integration from Guix profiles in Zsh configuration

  visual artifacts
- First-class BV Emacs theme authoring DSL for metadata, variants, anchors,
  surface/tone controls, semantic token domains, role overrides, face adapters,
  gallery metadata, policies, samples, and notes

  running Emacs configuration
- BV theme workflow probes that load representative Emacs surfaces, observe
  materialized faces, and gate their coverage during doctor runs
- Role-based Emacs layout system with shared frame defaults, display-aware frame profiles, buffer spatial roles, and popup window policy
- Icon-present, width-aware Emacs completion surface policy spanning Vertico, Consult, Marginalia, Embark, Orderless, Cape, Corfu, and Nerd Icons
- Inline, width-budgeted command annotations that keep Marginalia command docs
  readable without right-aligning them against the minibuffer edge.
- Semantic BV Emacs keybinding surface with `C-c` leader domains, live keymap
  audits, command-level key telemetry, and doctor-gated keybinding invariants
- PhD-grade Org cockpit in `bv-org.el` with stable commitment files, task state
  grammar, artifact-oriented capture routing, project scaffolding, agenda
  refresh, metrics updates, clock policy, and doctor-gated Org invariants
- Org Super Agenda-backed dashboard/review grouping with semantic TODO/tag/date/
  property selectors and PhD-specific section policies
- Refbox-rich bibliography completion using documented main/suffix templates,
  semantic resource indicators, Embark at-point actions, and theme-owned Refbox
  faces that no longer paint bibliographic rows as selected candidates
- Completion-surface theme polish for Corfu, popupinfo, Orderless, and Company,
  plus defaults that ignore stale Custom face overrides so the house light/dark
  surface, match, annotation, and scrollbar roles stay in control
- Tree-sitter grammar audit command (`bv-treesit-audit`)
- Project cockpit actions in `project-switch-project` (ripgrep, test, magit, dape)

- Brother HL-T4000DW CUPS driver provisioning for mileva and sparck, plus
  `setup.sh` queue bootstrap when the USB printer is connected.
- OpenClaw home service autostart for mileva.
### Fixed
- Destructive sync checks now resolve destination symlinks through the active
  route, including symlinked home configuration directories. Pull deletes also
  reject local home and protected destinations even with `--force`.
- `sync --delete` now refuses by what a path names, not how it is spelled. It
  refused `~` and `$HOME` but allowed `~/.`, `/home/<user>`, `/home/u/work/..`
  and `../..` from a project root -- each a whole home directory, which
  `rsync --delete` would empty. Paths are normalized first; the root, any
  top-level directory, any home directory, and anything containing the target's
  workdir are refused even with `--force`, which now lifts only the workdir
  itself. A path holding a shell variable is refused, since the remote side
  decides what it expands to. This newly refuses `--delete --force` against a
  workdir that *is* a home directory.
- `fleetctl exec` now reports a remote command killed by a signal as `128+N`
  (143 for SIGTERM, 137 for SIGKILL, 130 for SIGINT), matching `sh` and `ssh`,
  instead of the truncated `SystemExit` values 241/247 that read as unknown
  signals; a missing remote command exits 127 and a non-executable one 126,
  each with a one-line message rather than a Python traceback.
### Changed
- Simplified the Emacs Org setup around a single `~/org/main.org` file,
  removing the multi-file inbox/project/metrics/deadline machinery, dynamic
  agenda discovery and tracking module, idle auto-clockout timer, and related
  customization variables, plus the low-value org-ql, org-recur, and dailies
  wrapper modules and the custom Org dashboard/review agenda layer.
- Removed Refbox development checkout path wiring from the Emacs configuration
  so Refbox Lisp and daemon resolution come from the provisioned Emacs service.
- Routed Refbox-created org-slipbox notes through the normal `s` slipbox
  capture template so they inherit the configured notes directory and slug
  format.
- Aligned Org-cite bibliography discovery with Refbox's bibliography exclude
  paths and delayed Refbox Vertico multiform setup until the multiform feature
  is loaded.
- Tuned Refbox minibuffer and CAPF candidate page sizes to the visible Vertico
  surface so type-ahead completion no longer renders hidden 120-row pages.
- Switched Embark action display to a which-key panel, moved Embark help to
  `C-h`, and documented the Refbox-backed org-slipbox reference commands.
- Disabled Emacs key logging by default and hardened command-key capture when a
  command's raw key vector is unavailable.
- Lazily load `pdf-tools` before entering PDF view mode.
- Removed standalone Docker/containerd services from mileva while retaining OCI
  provisioning.
- Reworked the Codex `hifi-math-tts` skill around a model-first voice-actor
  script contract: agents read the source and write spoken English with
  complete mathematical fidelity, while deterministic scripts are limited to
  section planning, source evidence packets, coverage checks, coarse residue
  validation, acceptance sampling, and cleanup.
- Removed the brittle generated notation substitution stack from
  `hifi-math-tts`, including generated glossary construction, glossary
  coverage audits, auto-expansion, and equation hint validation, and added a
  source-to-script line audit path for quality calibration.
- Changed `hifi-math-tts` orchestration to require native sub-agent dispatch
  for multi-section generation instead of serial section drafting.
- Clarified `hifi-math-tts` scope so chapters and appendices are in scope by
  default, while front matter, end-of-chapter problems, answers or solutions,
  bibliography or references, and index are excluded unless explicitly
  requested.
- Hardened `hifi-math-tts` validation and review around default-excluded
  material, TeX-shaped volume-measure readings, and ambiguous fraction
  boundaries so stale plans and mechanical phrases are caught before readiness
  is claimed.
- Narrowed `hifi-math-tts` default-excluded heading detection so legitimate
  chapter sections such as "Solutions to Rotationally Invariant Problems" are
  not mistaken for end-of-book answer material.
- Clarified `hifi-math-tts` worker and review prompts around mechanical
  expansion artifacts and ambiguous powers on negative or multi-token bases,
  without turning those quality issues into a growing phrase blacklist.
- Clarified `hifi-math-tts` spoken-initialism guidance and validation so
  apostrophe-s plural forms such as `S D E's` are flagged before TTS handoff.
- Added `hifi-math-tts` boundary-coherence guidance so figures, tables,
  algorithms, displays, and captions that LaTeX places across section headings
  stay attached to their introducing prose in the spoken audiobook flow.
- Reworked `hifi-math-tts` dispatch language to mirror `hifi-pdf-ocr`: native
  parallel sub-agent orchestration is the required path for multi-section
  sources, and serial generation is a workflow failure unless sub-agent tooling
  is genuinely unavailable.
- Clarified `hifi-math-tts` book-scale execution to use source-local briefs and
  bounded native sub-agent waves per chapter or appendix, rather than serial
  section drafting or one unbriefed global queue.
- Removed the `hifi-math-tts` serial local-generation fallback for multi-section
  sources; if native sub-agent tooling is genuinely unavailable, the run now
  records the blocker and stops unless the user explicitly requests a serial
  fallback.
- Hardened `hifi-math-tts` readiness checks so duplicate equation identifiers,
  missing recorded acceptance reviews, and parent/manual serial dispatch in
  multi-section sources block `ready-for-tts` instead of being hidden behind
  clean script coverage.
- Hardened `hifi-math-tts` equation and caption auditing so shifted
  number-to-content mappings, collapsed lettered subequations, theorem or
  remark numbers mistaken for equation numbers, and table captions counted as
  figures are treated as readiness defects.
- Tightened `hifi-math-tts` cross-reference guidance so source-local numbering
  repairs propagate into prose references, instead of preserving stale numerals
  that point to the wrong displayed equation in the final script.
- Replaced the legacy BV Emacs theme engine with the new `bv-themes.el`
  compiler; `bv-light` and `bv-dark` are now standalone DSL-authored theme
  specifications loaded through the standard Custom theme path.
- Restored the BV Emacs light/dark Ink and Frost visual language as
  Oklch-authored aesthetic theme profiles, including the header band, Org
  title treatment, neutral minibuffer directory icons, file-permission color
  hierarchy, and visual compliance checks controlled by each theme's policy
  instead of forced on every base theme.
- Re-grounded the BV Emacs light/dark theme profiles in material pigment:
  sumi ink, washi paper, indigo/cobalt ceramic, bengara clay, moss/tea greens,
  oxidized copper, restrained yuzu, and less washed-out completion/modeline
  surfaces.
- Aligned org-slipbox node completions with the in-house minibuffer style by
  keeping node titles neutral and moving modified/backlink metadata into the
  annotation column.
- Unified remaining Emacs visual surfaces around the BV in-house style:
  width-aware TRAMP and Elfeed rows, theme-derived PDF night colors, semantic
  calendar/modeline/Refbox/Vertico/Cape/Corfu faces, and BV-owned icon roles
  including Octicon-family slipbox note icons.
- Promoted the BV Emacs headerline into a role-aware modeline system with
  diagnostics, modal task states, smarter project/branch display, hover help,
  inactive-window treatment, modeline ERT invariants, and theme regression
  coverage for representative modeline states.
- Refined BV Emacs read-only header status contrast and Magit section
  indicator spacing.
- Strengthened BV Emacs fringe/gutter affordances with heavier Magit disclosure
  bitmaps, clearer fringe contrast, and more substantial git-gutter markers.
- Added spaced global overflow indicators for truncated/wrapped lines and
  completion rows so continuation markers do not collide with text.
- Hardened `consult-buffer` source handling so optional buffer sources cannot
  surface as Vertico errors, and normalized Comint/slipbox buffer sources to
  Consult's native buffer-pair shape.
- Polished crowded BV Emacs package surfaces across Vertico counts, Which-Key,
  Org Agenda prefixes, Flymake diagnostic gutters, Ibuffer icon columns, Corfu
  kind labels, and Keycast fallback rendering.
- Rebuilt the BV Emacs icon stack around a semantic Nerd Icons role registry
  with typography-owned font selection, richer icon style policy,
  category-aware completion density, doctor coverage, and theme regression
  gallery coverage.
- Hardened BV Emacs completion icons and slipbox buffer sources so file-backed
  buffers preserve file icon semantics while malformed virtual candidates cannot
  break Vertico.
- Split Emacs doctor validation into a hermetic batch gate and a live full-init
  gate for runtime theme workflow checks.
- Expanded BV Emacs theme audits for diagnostics, completion, diff, terminal,
  prose heading, metadata, and local semantic face invariants.
- Expanded BV Emacs theme doctor validation to exercise workflow probes before
  live face inventory checks.
- Expanded BV Emacs theme regression artifacts into deterministic workflow
  SVGs covering prose, code, diffs, completion, diagnostics, Dired, terminal
  colors, modelines, calendar, and feed rows with manifest validation.
- Updated the Emacs customization guide for the DSL-based BV theme system and
  removed references to retired theme defcustoms.
- `fssh` now includes `fleetctl` targets alongside classic SSH host discovery and routes `fleet:*` selections through `fleetctl ssh`
- `fleetctl migrate-env` no longer carries a repo-specific default env prefix and now requires an explicit `--prefix`
- `fleetctl` now treats target `workdir` as the host landing strip and derives default project roots as `workdir/<project-name>`
- `fleetctl smoke` now reports whether a configured project landing strip exists without treating a missing repo checkout as a transport failure
- `fleetctl` now renders `~/.config/fleet/` from dotfiles templates plus pass-backed private source data, and `setup.sh` deploys that generated fleet config automatically when the `infra/fleet` pass prefix is present
- Expanded the Codex `hifi-pdf-ocr` skill with final workspace pruning guidance and helper tooling
- Mileva now mounts the `my-data` Btrfs filesystem at `/data`
- Changed the default Emacs org-slipbox store to `~/org/myslipbox`, with
  ordinary notes captured under `notes/`.
- Changed Emacs org-slipbox note filenames to use dashed `HH-MM-SS`
  timestamp components.
- Relaxed global Git SSH key ignore patterns so exact private/public key
  filenames stay ignored without also ignoring encrypted `pass` entries such as
  `id_ed25519.gpg`
- Formatted Guix machine configurations with guix style for consistency
- Refactored scripts with guix style formatting and cleaned up new-client-cert
- Modularized Emacs configuration into focused components
- Aligned org-slipbox node picker metadata into fixed-width title, modified, backlink, and tag columns
- Migrated the Emacs slipbox configuration fully to org-slipbox and removed the legacy compatibility layer
- Hardened Elfeed startup so a corrupt database index warns cleanly instead of breaking Emacs initialization

- Replaced obsolete Org inline-preview and source-edit indentation APIs in the Emacs configuration
- Consolidated Emacs layout ownership across early init, defaults, and layout modules
- Reworked the Emacs completion stack around minibuffer-first adaptive annotations, row-heavy Consult buffer displays, deterministic Cape CAPFs, and precision-auto Corfu profiles
- Reworked Emacs defaults around role-aware focus, cleaner editing/session baselines, predictable scrolling, and dedicated ownership for terminal/tree-sitter setup
- Tweaked BV Emacs dark theme foundation colors for a richer background tint and crisper text contrast
- Tweaked Alacritty dark palette for richer backgrounds and sharper text contrast

- Enabled right-only window dividers for clearer window separation
- Enabled `save-place`, `auto-revert`, `repeat-mode`, and pixel-precise scrolling defaults
- Expanded Vertico multiform categories and tuned Consult preview behavior for faster “peek” navigation
- Consult buffer narrowing now has a preferred cycle order (`bv-consult-narrow-cycle-order`) plus `?` help and source echoing
- Made Corfu auto-popup mode-aware (manual in `git-commit-mode` buffers)
- Calmed Eglot progress/events noise and added a Flymake quickfix helper (`bv-flymake-quickfix`)
- Added a dedicated Eglot “peek” keymap (`C-c l …`) and Flymake fix-loop prefix (`C-c ! …`)
- Improved TTY parity (mouse wheel + Corfu terminal awareness) and prefer newer `.el` over stale `.elc`
- Extended tree-sitter remaps (yaml/json/toml/css/html/dockerfile) and set `treesit-font-lock-level` to 4
- Tightened diagnostics UX: Flymake next/prev now “peek” messages at point, plus `bv-flymake-show-at-point`

- Improved default search ergonomics with `bv-consult-search` (DWIM project ripgrep vs cross-buffer search)
- Made `xref` use ripgrep backend when available
- Open CUDA files (`.cu`/`.cuh`) in C++ tree-sitter mode by default
- Zsh prompt now shows active environment names (virtualenv/Guix/direnv) and `l` is the default `eza` listing alias

- Updated Alacritty’s BV light/dark palettes to match BV Emacs themes (including selection/search surfaces)
- Simplified Org configuration: default TODO/DONE only with a single inbox file and minimal capture/agenda bindings
- Extended `setup.sh` to auto-link repository Codex skills into `~/.codex/skills`
- Updated `setup.sh` to keep `~/.codex/config.toml` as a local file and stop symlinking it from dotfiles
- Refined the Codex `research-paper-notes` skill with multi-axis paper coordinates, claim-surface summaries, typed prior-work relation hints, and stronger machine-readable provenance
- Reworked the BV Emacs header-line modeline as a responsive segment renderer
  with Org `#+TITLE` display, width-aware truncation, status accents, and
  priority-based right-side metadata, including BV-owned keycast integration,
  polished status-block geometry, and quieter scratch-buffer context.
- Defined BV semantic/header faces before theme compilation so in-house faces
  receive generated theme styling on first load.
### Fixed
- Sanitized BV modeline/header-line dynamic fields so `display-time-string` and
  other mode-line fragments cannot leak package backgrounds into the header.
- Made BV Emacs theme audit and regression commands load discoverable DSL
  theme specifications before compiling artifacts from a fresh runtime.
- Enabled `fprintd` on `sparck` and added the CLI package to the shared
  security bundle for ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12 fingerprint enrollment
- Forced Intel DPCD backlight control on `sparck` and added `brightnessctl`

- `fleetctl doctor` now flags misplaced repo-specific or sensitive fields in target metadata so stale target `workdir` state does not linger silently
- Scrubbed `kyma` and `mileva` as baked-in examples from the public `fleetctl` docs so the tool surface stays project-agnostic
- Fixed `fleetctl exec` so project-default execution works when omitting the selector and added an explicit `--target` form for unambiguous routing
- Fixed `fleetctl script` uploads for `~/.local/...` remote script roots by normalizing scp paths instead of relying on remote `~` expansion
- Fixed `fleetctl sync push` so directory sources sync into the intended project root instead of creating nested destination directories

- Removed restrictive ZSH_EVAL_CONTEXT check preventing shell startup
- Eliminated Zsh welcome message for cleaner shell initialization
- Resolved Zsh startup errors and plugin loading issues

- Removed redundant custom zprofile configuration
- Corrected multiple import and configuration errors in mileva.scm
- Fixed indentation in sparck system services configuration
- Restored completion-at-point in `git-commit-mode` buffers

- Normalized Org LaTeX preview scaling to better match text size across displays
- Removed misleading per-display DPI assumptions from Org LaTeX preview sizing and refreshed previews when moving frames between displays
- Made AUCTeX previews scale from the current face (instead of a fixed number) for consistent math rendering across font sizes
- Restored Tempel `;snippet` expansion on `TAB` for Org/LaTeX buffers and aligned the `im` template with Org-style inline math (`\\( ... \\)`)
- Cleared Emacs config doctor byte-compile warnings and made display-local font adjustments/reset behavior consistent across frames
- Cleaned up Tempel LaTeX templates: resolved trigger collisions, added missing aliases, enabled `*`-suffixed triggers (e.g. `eq*`), and made inline-math templates available in `latex-mode`
- Resolved Tempel math template trigger collisions while syncing generated files with `templates.org`
- Prevented Org LaTeX auto-refresh and `org-fragtog` from throwing errors during window/buffer changes
- Stabilized Org clocking: clock-in/out no longer steals windows, clock-in starts on first invocation, and redundant STARTED→STARTED logs are avoided
- Updated Org capture templates to the new `file+olp+datetree` format to avoid deprecation noise at startup
- Silenced noisy circadian enable/disable messages during startup
- Silenced repeat-mode enable message during startup
- Disabled hl-line highlighting in Org buffers
- Fixed Magit status buffer errors caused by stale native-compiled Magit code expecting `magit-section-visibility-indicator` as a variable
